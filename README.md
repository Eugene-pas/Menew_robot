Hello, dear reader.
Telegram works on most devices and has a web version, so we decided that there was no point in complicating it and used a bot as the interface.

The following commands are available to users:
/find_meal_by_name - search for meal by name
/get_your_ingredient - get all your ingredients
/select_meal_for_ingredients - get meal according to the ingredients
/add_ingredients - add new ingredients

Our project is hosted on our server, as it will only be used by the jury, so it is the most profitable option in this case.
This project was not difficult, but very useful for team cohesion. The acquired knowledge will help us a lot in the future competition.
